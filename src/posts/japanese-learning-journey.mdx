# My Japanese Learning Journey: From Anime to Academic Study

Five years ago, I was just another person who thought Japanese looked cool in anime. Today, I'm pursuing a minor in Japan Studies at NC State and building AI tools for language learning. Here's how that transformation happened.

## The Anime Gateway

Let's be honest - anime got me interested in Japanese. But unlike many people who stop at recognizing a few common phrases, I was curious about the underlying structure of the language. Why did sentence order seem so different? What were all those particles doing?

This curiosity led me to actually start studying seriously.

## The Textbook Phase

I started with **Genki I** like most self-learners. The structured approach was exactly what I needed coming from a programming background. Grammar rules felt like syntax, and the logical progression reminded me of learning a new programming language.

Key breakthroughs in this phase:
- Understanding that Japanese grammar is actually quite regular
- Realizing that politeness levels are systematic, not random
- Learning to think in terms of particles and grammatical functions

## Formal Academic Study

When I got to NC State, I decided to make Japanese study official by declaring a Japan Studies minor. This decision transformed my learning:

- **Structured progression** through intermediate and advanced grammar
- **Cultural context** that textbooks often skip
- **Academic writing** in Japanese (much harder than conversation!)
- **Literature and media analysis** that deepened cultural understanding

## The Technical Side

My programming background has been incredibly helpful:
- **Pattern recognition** skills transfer perfectly to grammar patterns
- **Debugging mindset** helps when sentences don't make sense
- **Tool building** - I've created several apps to help with my studies

## Current Level and Goals

After five years, I'm comfortable with:
- Daily conversation and most business situations
- Reading news articles and literature (with occasional dictionary lookups)
- Writing formal emails and academic papers
- Understanding various dialects and speech patterns

My current goals:
- Pass the N2 level of the JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test)
- Study abroad in Japan (hopefully next year!)
- Build more language learning tools
- Eventually work for a Japanese company or in US-Japan business

## Advice for Other Learners

If you're thinking about seriously studying Japanese:

1. **Start with the basics** - Don't skip hiragana and katakana
2. **Use multiple resources** - Textbooks, apps, anime, and real conversation
3. **Find your "why"** - Whether it's anime, business, or culture, having a clear motivation helps
4. **Be patient with yourself** - Japanese is genuinely challenging for English speakers
5. **Use technology** - There are amazing tools available now that didn't exist even five years ago

## The Intersection with Tech

One of the most exciting aspects of my journey has been combining Japanese study with programming. This led to building Kakitori and other language learning tools. There's so much potential for technology to make language learning more effective and engaging.

Japanese has taught me patience, cultural sensitivity, and the value of long-term commitment. These skills have made me a better programmer and a more thoughtful person overall.

頑張って！(Good luck!)
