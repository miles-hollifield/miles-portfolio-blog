# Building Kakitori: An AI-Powered Japanese Grammar Practice App

As someone studying both Computer Science and Japanese, I've always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and language learning. Traditional grammar drills can be repetitive and boring, so I decided to build something better: **Kakitori** (書き取り), an AI-powered web app that generates personalized Japanese grammar practice sentences.

## The Problem with Traditional Grammar Practice

Most Japanese textbooks give you the same 10-15 example sentences for each grammar point. After drilling these a few times, you've memorized the specific examples rather than truly understanding the grammar pattern. This is where AI can make a real difference.

## How Kakitori Works

Kakitori uses modern AI to generate fresh, contextually appropriate sentences for any grammar point you're studying. Here's the technical approach:

- **Next.js** frontend with a clean, mobile-first interface
- **OpenAI GPT-4** for generating grammatically correct, natural sentences
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive styling
- **Vercel** for deployment and serverless functions

The app takes a Japanese grammar pattern (like て-form + います) and generates multiple unique sentences that use that pattern in different contexts - from everyday conversations to business situations.

## Key Features

1. **Contextual Variety**: Sentences span different situations (restaurant, school, work, etc.)
2. **Difficulty Scaling**: Adjust vocabulary complexity based on your level
3. **Immediate Feedback**: Check your translations instantly
4. **Progress Tracking**: See which patterns you've mastered

## What I Learned

Building Kakitori taught me several important lessons:

- **AI prompt engineering** is crucial for consistent, quality output
- **Japanese typography** presents unique challenges for web design
- **Language learners** want tools that adapt to their specific needs
- **User feedback** is essential for refining learning experiences

## Next Steps

I'm currently working on adding features like:
- Spaced repetition algorithms
- Audio pronunciation practice
- Integration with popular Japanese learning resources

Building tools for language learning combines my passions for technology and Japanese culture. It's rewarding to create something that helps others on their language journey while pushing my own technical skills forward.
