# Why I Chose NC State for Computer Science

Choosing a university is one of the biggest decisions you make as a young person. For me, NC State wasn't just about the Computer Science program - it was about finding a place where I could grow as both a technologist and a person. Here's why I chose NC State and how it's lived up to my expectations.

## The Academic Appeal

NC State's Computer Science program has a solid reputation, but what really attracted me was the breadth of opportunities:

**Strong fundamentals**: The curriculum covers everything from low-level systems programming to high-level software architecture. This foundation has been invaluable in my internships and personal projects.

**Research opportunities**: Even as an undergraduate, I've had chances to work on research projects. The faculty are approachable and genuinely interested in mentoring students.

**Industry connections**: NC State has strong ties to the Research Triangle's tech scene. This means internship opportunities, guest lectures from industry professionals, and career fair events with companies I actually want to work for.

## The Japan Studies Connection

One unique aspect of my NC State experience has been adding a Japan Studies minor. This wasn't something I planned when I first enrolled, but the program's flexibility allowed me to explore this interest.

The combination has been powerful:
- Cultural perspective that's valuable in our global tech economy
- Language skills that open doors to international opportunities
- A different way of thinking about problem-solving and design

## Campus Culture and Community

NC State has a collaborative rather than competitive culture. Students help each other succeed rather than trying to outdo each other. This has been especially valuable in challenging CS courses where study groups and peer learning make all the difference.

The size is also perfect - large enough to have diverse opportunities and resources, but not so large that you feel lost in the crowd.

## Practical Learning Opportunities

What I love most about NC State's approach is the emphasis on practical application:

**Project-based learning**: Almost every class includes significant projects where you build real systems, not just theoretical exercises.

**Industry partnerships**: Companies regularly sponsor class projects, giving students exposure to real-world problems.

**Hackathons and competitions**: The university actively supports participation in programming competitions and hackathons.

## Mentorship and Support

The faculty at NC State genuinely care about student success. I've had professors who:
- Helped me prepare for technical interviews
- Connected me with internship opportunities
- Provided guidance on graduate school and career decisions
- Encouraged me to pursue personal projects like Kakitori

## The Research Triangle Advantage

Being in Raleigh puts you at the heart of one of the country's major tech hubs. This means:
- Internship opportunities with companies like IBM, Cisco, and Red Hat
- Networking events and tech meetups
- A thriving startup ecosystem
- Post-graduation job opportunities without having to relocate

## Challenges and Growth

NC State hasn't been without challenges. The CS program is rigorous, and there have been times when I've felt overwhelmed. But these challenges have led to the most growth:

- **Time management**: Learning to balance coursework, internships, and personal projects
- **Technical depth**: Pushing through difficult concepts until they click
- **Collaboration**: Working effectively in teams with diverse skill levels
- **Problem-solving**: Developing the persistence to work through complex bugs and design challenges

## What I Wish I'd Known

Looking back, there are a few things I wish I'd known when starting:

1. **Get involved early**: Join clubs, attend events, and start building your network from day one
2. **Don't be afraid to ask questions**: Professors and classmates are more helpful than you think
3. **Start personal projects**: The most interesting conversations I've had have been about projects I built outside of class
4. **Take advantage of career services**: They're genuinely helpful, not just for job placement but for career guidance

## Looking Forward

As I approach my senior year, I'm grateful for choosing NC State. The program has given me:
- A strong technical foundation
- Practical experience through internships and projects
- A diverse perspective through my Japan Studies minor
- Connections that will last throughout my career
- The confidence to tackle complex problems

For anyone considering NC State's Computer Science program, I'd say: if you're looking for a place that will challenge you academically while providing practical opportunities and a supportive community, it's worth serious consideration.

The Research Triangle is an amazing place to start a career in tech, and NC State gives you the tools and connections to make the most of it.
