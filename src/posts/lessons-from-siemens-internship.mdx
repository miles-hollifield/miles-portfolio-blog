# From Classroom to Corporate: Lessons from My Siemens Internship

Last summer, I had the incredible opportunity to intern as a software engineer at Siemens. Going from writing small class projects to contributing to enterprise-level software was both exciting and humbling. Here's what I learned.

## The Scale Shock

My first day, I was shown the codebase I'd be working with. Coming from university projects with maybe 1,000 lines of code, I was suddenly looking at millions of lines across dozens of repositories. The scale was overwhelming.

**Key lesson**: Real software systems are complex ecosystems, not single applications.

## Code Quality Matters More Than You Think

In school, if your code worked, you were done. At Siemens, I learned that working code is just the beginning. Every line was reviewed, tested, and had to meet strict quality standards.

I learned about:
- **Code reviews** as a collaborative learning tool
- **Test-driven development** and why it actually saves time
- **Documentation** as communication with your future self
- **Linting and formatting** for consistency across large teams

## The Art of Technical Communication

Writing code is maybe 30% of a software engineer's job. The rest is communication:
- Explaining technical decisions to non-technical stakeholders
- Writing clear documentation that teammates can actually use
- Participating in design discussions and architecture reviews
- Debugging issues by clearly describing problems

## Real-World Problem Solving

University problems have clean, well-defined solutions. Real-world problems are messy:
- Requirements change mid-project
- Legacy systems impose constraints you never expected
- Performance matters in ways you don't anticipate in small projects
- User feedback reveals assumptions you didn't know you were making

## Technologies I Learned

During my internship, I worked with:
- **C#/.NET** for backend services
- **React** for frontend interfaces
- **Azure** for cloud infrastructure
- **Docker** for containerization
- **Git** workflows for large teams

But more importantly, I learned how to learn new technologies quickly when the project demands it.

## The Mentorship Experience

One of the best parts of the internship was having experienced engineers as mentors. They taught me:
- How to break down complex problems into manageable pieces
- The importance of asking questions (even "dumb" ones)
- How to research solutions effectively
- When to ask for help vs. when to struggle through on your own

## Project Impact

I contributed to a digital twin platform for industrial equipment. Seeing actual customers use features I helped build was incredibly rewarding. It reinforced why I want to work on software that solves real problems for real people.

## How It Changed My Approach

The internship fundamentally changed how I approach personal projects:

1. **Planning first**: I now spend more time designing before coding
2. **Testing from the start**: Unit tests aren't an afterthought anymore
3. **User-focused**: I consider the actual user experience, not just functionality
4. **Sustainable code**: I write code that I (and others) can maintain

## Advice for Future Interns

If you're preparing for a software engineering internship:

1. **Don't worry about knowing everything** - You're there to learn
2. **Ask questions** - Your mentors expect it and appreciate engaged interns
3. **Take notes** - You'll learn a lot in a short time
4. **Network** - The relationships you build are as valuable as the technical skills
5. **Document your contributions** - Great material for future job applications

## Looking Forward

The internship confirmed that I want to pursue a career in software engineering. It also showed me areas where I want to improve:
- System design and architecture
- Cloud technologies and DevOps
- Project management skills
- Cross-functional collaboration

Most importantly, it taught me that software engineering is fundamentally about solving problems for people. The technology is just the tool - the real work is understanding problems deeply and crafting solutions that make people's lives better.

I'm grateful for the experience and excited to apply these lessons to my future projects, including my current work on Kakitori and other personal projects.
